# Lenz

> A simple, cross-platform app for reviewing photos and picking favorites.

## Etymology

Lenz is the latest in a series of applications written to support my photography workflow and explore new technologies.

- ImageReviewer, [Windows Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms)
- PhotoReviewer, [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation)
- [Loupe](https://dlaa.me/Loupe/), [XAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language)
- [Lenz](https://github.com/DavidAnson/Lenz), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)

The name is a contrived combination of [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lens) from photography and [Lenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law), a physicist who investigated magnetic fields (such as those [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment) by an electron moving in a loop).

*This is a work in progress...*
